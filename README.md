# HTML Wikipedia Terrier

Welcome to my first HTML and CSS project!  
This page presents some information about terriers, with headings and paragraphs taken from Wikipedia and styled using CSS.

## Project Overview
- **HTML Structure**: Used headings (`<h1>`–`<h6>`) and paragraphs (`<p>`) to organize content.
- **CSS Styling**: Simple styles applied to make the page visually appealing.
- **Content**: Focused on terriers – different types, characteristics, and general information.

## Project Files
- `index.html` — the main page with content
- `style.css` — CSS styles for the page

This project was created as part of a DCI assignment to practice HTML and CSS fundamentals.
