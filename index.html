        <h1>Wire Fox Terrier</h1>
        <p>The Wire Fox Terrier (also known as Wire Hair Fox Terrier, Wirehaired Terrier or simply Fox Terrier) is a breed of dog, 
            one of many terrier breeds. It is a fox terrier, and although it bears a resemblance to the Smooth Fox Terrier, 
            they are believed to have been developed separately. It originates from England.</p>
    
        <h3>Appearance</h3>
        <p>The Wire Fox Terrier is a sturdy, balanced dog weighing 7.7 to 8.6 kg (17 to 19 lb) for males
             and 6.8 to 7.7 kg (15 to 17 lb) for females. It should not be more than 39 cm (15+1‚ÅÑ2 in) at the withers.</p>
    
        <h2>Temperament</h2>
        <p>Two of the Wire Fox Terrier's most distinctive traits are its energy and intelligence.
             It has a low threshold for boredom and requires stimulation, exercise and attention. 
            The Wire Fox Terrier is a companion animal that requires near-constant attention.</p>

        <h4>History</h4>
        <p>The Wire Fox Terrier was developed in England by fox hunting enthusiasts and is believed
            to be descended from a now-extinct rough-coated, black-and-tan working terrier of Wales, Derbyshire, and Durham. 
            The breed was also thought to have been bred to chase foxes into their burrows;
            the dogs' short, strong, usually docked tails were used as handles by the hunter to pull them back out.</p>

         <h5>Grooming</h5>  
         <p>Wire Fox Terriers kept for show are hand stripped; if the hair becomes too long,
            it is taken out by hand in order to preserve the colours and the glossiness of the coat. 
            Many kept as pets are clipped monthly by a groomer.
            Clipping dulls the colours and makes the coat soft, curly and more difficult to keep clean,
            but it is preferred by many owners due to being a simpler (and cheaper) procedure than stripping.</p>
